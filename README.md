Language support for Java &trade; for Visual Studio Code
=====================

Provides Java &trade; language support via
[java-language-server](https://github.com/gorkem/java-language-server), which utilizes
[Eclipse &trade; JDT](http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/).

Quick Start
============
1. Install the Extension
2. If you do not have a _Java 8_ Development Kit on current system path or _JAVA_HOME_ is not correctly set to point to one
    * Download and install a Java 8 compatible development kit.
3. Extension is activated when you first access a Java file.
    * Initial activation can be longer since it requires extension to download additional parts.
    * Recognizes only projects with *maven* build files on the directory hierarchy, or to a lesser extent, simple Eclipse projects, i.e. containing .project and .classpath files. 

Features 
=========

Supported settings
==================
Starting from version 0.0.5, the following settings are supported:

* `java.home` : Absolute path to JDK 8 home folder used to launch the Java Language Server. Requires VS Code restart.
* `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` : Extra VM arguments used to launch the Java Language Server. Requires VS Code restart.

Troubleshooting
===============
1. Due to size restrictions on the marketplace extension downloads additional required parts check that they 
are downloaded under `~/.vscode/extensions/redhat.java-0.0.5/server` folder. 
You should see a folder named `plugins`.

2. Check the status of the language tools on the lower right corner (marked with A on image below).
It should show ready (thumbs up) as on the image below. You can click on the status and open the 
language tool logs for further information in case of a failure.
