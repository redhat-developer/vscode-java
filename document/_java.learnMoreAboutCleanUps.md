# Java Clean Ups

Java clean ups are run on the current document whenever it's saved.
They can fix a wide variety of issues, from code style to programming mistakes,
and can even modernize the sources based on new Java language features.
Here is some information on the supported cleanups and the details of what they do.

### `qualifyMembers`

Whenever a member (field or method) of a class is accessed from within the class,
prefix the access with `this`.
This is similar to how Python requires the programmer to access members using `self`.

For instance:

```java
private int value;

public void getValue() {
	return value;
}
```

becomes:

```java
private int value;

public void getValue() {
	return this.value;
}
```

### `qualifyStaticMembers`

Whenever there is a static variable or function, prefix the access with the name of the class that the static variable or function belongs to.

For instance:

```java
import static java.lang.System.out;

public class MyClass {
	public static final double FACTOR = 0.5;

	public double getNumber(double value) {
		out.println("moo");
		return value * FACTOR;
	}
}
```

becomes:

```java
import static java.lang.System.out;

public class MyClass {
	public static final double FACTOR = 0.5;

	public double getNumber(double value) {
		System.out.println("moo");
		return value * MyClass.FACTOR;
	}
}
```

### `addOverride`

When a method of a class that overrides a method from a parent class or provides an implementation for a method from an interface, add the `@Override` annotation.

For example:

```java
public class MyRunner implements Runnable {
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
```

becomes:

```java
public class MyRunner implements Runnable {
	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
```

### `addDeprecated`

When a method is marked `@deprecated` in the Javadoc, but doesn't have the `@Deprecated` annotation, add the `@Deprecated` annotation.
This only works if the compiler has been configured to mark deprecated methods without the deprecated annotation
as an info/warning/error in the JDT settings.

For example:

```java
/**
 * Not used anymore, please stop using.
 *
 * @deprecated
 */
public boolean isAGoat() {
	return false;
}
```

becomes:

```java
/**
 * Not used anymore, please stop using.
 *
 * @deprecated
 */
@Deprecated
public boolean isAGoat() {
	return false;
}
```

### `stringConcatToTextBlock`

Appropriate String concatenations will be converted into Java `Text Blocks`. Appropriate String concatenations must have at least 3 non-empty substrings with one per line and the Java level must be 15 or higher. Line comments for all substrings but the last line will be lost after conversion. Spaces at the end of substrings preceding the newline will result in `\s` being substituted while substrings that do not end with newlines will have a `\` added at the end of the line to preserve concatenation.

For example:

```java
String x = "" +
	"public class A {\n" +
	"    public void m() {\n" +
	"        System.out.println(\"abc\");\n" +
	"    }\n" +
	"}";
```

becomes:

```java
String x = """
	public class A {
		public void m() {
			System.out.println("abc");
		}
	}""";
```
