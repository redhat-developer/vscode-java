# How to contribute

Contributions are essential for keeping this extension great.
We try to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes and we are
open to suggestions for making it even easier.
There are only a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow.

## vscode-java vs eclipse.jdt.ls

vscode-java is a Visual Studio Code extension that uses a language server for its Java language
smartness. Usually vscode-java features depend on the [Eclipse &trade; JDT Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls),
(a.k.a. eclipse.jdt.ls) and the contributions should be coordinated between the two repositories.

## First Time Setup
1. Install prerequisites:
   * latest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4.0.0 or higher
2. Fork and clone the repository
3. `cd vscode-java`
4. Install the dependencies:

	```bash
	$ npm install
	```
5. Open the folder in VS Code

## Building Eclipse &trade; JDT Language Server
This assumes that you are starting on the `vscode-java` directory

1. `cd ..`
2. Fork and clone the [eclipse.jdt.ls](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls) repository
3. Build server

	```bash
	$ cd ..\vscode-java
	$ npm run build-server
	```
You can run faster server builds during development by calling `./node_modules/.bin/gulp dev_server` script instead, this will build server binaries that are required by your host OS only. You can also use `npm run watch-server` which will build and place them on the extension for Java changes. These commands run Maven in offline mode, so you might need to run `build-server` at least once, to fetch all the dependencies.

This will build and place the binaries under the `server` folder. Alternately you can download and use the latest snapshot build from [Eclipse &trade; JDT Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls) project with the following

	```bash
	$ cd ..\vscode-java
	$ ./node_modules/.bin/gulp download_server
	```

## Run with a remote JDT language server

While developing the language server and the extension, you don't need to deploy the server every time to try out changes. Instead you can run the language server out of its Eclipse workspace:

- Open VSCode on the `vscode-java` folder
- In the debug viewlet, run the launch _Launch Extension - Remote Server_
- The extension will open a socket on port 3333 and will wait for the JDT language server to connect
- In Eclipse, run the JDT language server as an Eclipse application. 
   - Create a debug configuration of type _Eclipse Application_.
   - In the main tab of the debug configuration select `Run a Product` instead of `Run an Application`.
   - Set the product to `org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.product`.
   - In the Environment tab, define a variable `CLIENT_PORT` with value `3333`.
   - If your workspace contains 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui', use the Plug-Ins tab in the debug configuration to exclude the plug-in. The presence of 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui' will cause the language server to hang. 
- In the debug console of VSCode you can see if the connection was successful.
- When the server is running breakpoints can be reached and hot code replace can be used to make fixes without restarting the server.
- You can modify `.vscode/launch.json` to use a different port:
    - Modify `SERVER_PORT` under `env` to specify the port the JST LS server should connect to.

## Sideloading

You can create a binary that you can sideload to your VS Code installation.

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. `cd vscode-java`
3. Install the dependencies:

	```bash
	$ npm install
	```
4. Optionally, follow the instruction to build the server.
5. See documentation on [extension installation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/docs/extensions/publish-extension.md)
on ways to sideload or share.

# Reporting issues
If you encounter a problem and know it is caused by eclipse.jdt.ls, then please open a bug report over [there](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls/issues).
In doubt, you can report issues in the [vscode-java issue tracker](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues).

Try to collect as much informations as you can to describe the issue and help us reproduce the problem. Head over to the [troubleshooting page](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/wiki/Troubleshooting#enable-logging) to see how to collect useful logging informations.
