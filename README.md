=====================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/redhat-developer/vscode-java](https://badges.gitter.im/redhat-developer/vscode-java.svg)](https://gitter.im/redhat-developer/vscode-java?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redhat-developer/vscode-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redhat-developer/vscode-java) [![Marketplace Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/redhat.java.svg "Current Release")](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)

Provides Java &trade; language support via
[Eclipse &trade; JDT Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls), which utilizes
[Eclipse &trade; JDT](http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/), [M2Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) and [Buildship](https://github.com/eclipse/buildship).

Quick Start
============
1. Install the Extension
2. If you do not have a _Java_ Development Kit correctly [set](#setting-the-jdk)
    * Download and install a recent Java Development Kit (latest Java 11 is the current minimum requirement).
3. Extension is activated when you first access a Java file
    * Recognizes projects with *Maven* or *Gradle* build files in the directory hierarchy.

Features
=========

To launch and debug your Java programs, it's recommended you install *[Java Debug Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)*.

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest release. You might also find useful information in the project [Wiki](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/wiki).

Setting the JDK
===============
## Java Tooling JDK
This JDK will be used to launch the Java Language Server. And by default, will also be used to compile your projects.

The path to the Java Development Kit can be specified by the `java.home` setting in VS Code settings (workspace/user settings). If not specified, it is searched in the following order until a JDK meets current minimum requirement.

- the `JDK_HOME` environment variable
- the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
- on the current system path

## Project JDKs
If you need to compile your projects against a different JDK version, it's recommended you configure the `java.configuration.runtimes` property in your user settings, eg:

```json
"java.configuration.runtimes": [
  {
    "name": "JavaSE-1.8",
    "path": "/path/to/jdk-8",
  },
  {
    "name": "JavaSE-11",
    "path": "/path/to/jdk-11",
  },
  {
    "name": "JavaSE-16",
    "path": "/path/to/jdk-16",
    "default": true
  },
]
```
The default runtime will be used when you open standalone Java files.

Available commands
==========================
The following commands are available:
- `Switch to Standard Mode`: switches the Java Language Server to `Standard` mode. This command is only available when the Java Language Server is in `LightWeight` mode.
- `Java: Update Project` (`Shift+Alt+U`): is available when the editor is focused on a Maven pom.xml or a Gradle file. It forces project configuration / classpath updates (eg. dependency changes or Java compilation level), according to the project build descriptor.
- `Java: Import Java Projects into Workspace`: detects and imports all the Java projects into the Java Language Server workspace.
- `Java: Open Java Language Server Log File`: opens the Java Language Server log file, useful for troubleshooting problems.
- `Java: Open Java Extension Log File`: opens the Java extension log file, useful for troubleshooting problems.
- `Java: Open All Log Files`: opens both the Java Language Server log file and the Java extension log file.
- `Java: Force Java Compilation` (`Shift+Alt+B`): manually triggers compilation of the workspace.
- `Java: Open Java Formatter Settings`: opens the Eclipse formatter settings. Creates a new settings file if none exists.
- `Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace`: cleans the Java language server workspace.
- `Java: Attach Source`: attaches a jar/zip source to the currently opened binary class file. This command is only available in the editor context menu.
- `Java: Add Folder to Java Source Path`: adds the selected folder to its project source path. This command is only available in the file explorer context menu and only works for unmanaged folders.
- `Java: Remove Folder from Java Source Path`: removes the selected folder from its project source path. This command is only available in the file explorer context menu and only works for unmanaged folders.
- `Java: List All Java Source Paths`: lists all the Java source paths recognized by the Java Language Server workspace.
- `Java: Show Build Job Status`: shows the Java Language Server job status in Visual Studio Code terminal.
- `Java: Go to Super Implementation`: goes to the super implementation for the current selected symbol in editor.

Semantic Highlighting
===============
[Semantic Highlighting](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/wiki/Semantic-Highlighting) is controlled by the `java.semanticHighlighting.enabled` preference. When enabled, it fixes numerous syntax highlighting issues with the default Java Textmate grammar. However, you might experience different small issues, particularly a delay when it kicks in, as it needs to be computed by the Java Language server, when opening a new file or when typing.

Troubleshooting
===============
1. Check the status of the language tools on the lower right corner (marked with A on image below).
It should show ready (thumbs up) as on the image below. You can click on the status and open the
language tool logs for further information in case of a failure.
